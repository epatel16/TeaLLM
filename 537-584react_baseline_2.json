I should search for information about Subhas Chandra Bose's attempt during World War II.\n\nAction 2: search | Subhas Chandra Bose | what war did Subhas Chandra Bose attempt to rid India of British rule during? | war\nObservation 2: Subhas Chandra Bose attempted to rid India of British rule during World War II. He defied British authority in India and formed wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan to fight for India's independence. Bose advocated for mass civil disobedience against the British Viceroy's decision to declare war on India's behalf without consulting Congress leadership, leading to his imprisonment and hunger strike. Subhas Chandra Bose attempted to rid India of British rule during World War II. He formed the Indian Legion from Indian prisoners of war to serve under him and sought support from Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. Despite his efforts, Bose was disappointed by the lack of response from Nazi Germany and eventually left for Japanese-occupied southeast Asia in 1943. Subhas Chandra Bose attempted to rid India of British rule during World War II. He formed the Indian National Army (INA) and collaborated with the Axis powers, including Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, to fight against British forces in India. Despite facing military reverses, Bose maintained support for the Azad Hind movement and established the Azad Hind Government, which was recognized by nine Axis states. Subhas Chandra Bose attempted to rid India of British rule during World War II. He revamped the Indian National Army with Japanese support, declared a Provisional Government of Free India, and led the INA in battles against the British Indian Army in Burmese territory. However, the INA's aim of establishing a base in mainland India was lost after the Japanese defeat at the battles of Kohima and Imphal. Bose eventually left for Japan in 1943, disillusioned with Germany's help in gaining India's independence. There is no information in the text provided about the specific war during which Subhas Chandra Bose attempted to rid India of British rule. \n\nSummary: Bose's defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among many Indians, but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy fraught with authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure.\nThought 3: The text provides a lot of information about Subhas Chandra Bose's attempts to rid India of British rule during World War II, but it does not explicitly mention the troubled legacy left by his actions. I should search for more details on the troubled legacy of Subhas Chandra Bose's attempt during World War II.\n\nAction 3: search | Subhas Chandra Bose | what troubled legacy did Subhas Chandra Bose leave from his attempt to rid India of British rule during World War II? |\nObservation 3: Subhas Chandra Bose, an Indian nationalist, left a troubled legacy due to his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, which were marked by authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure. Despite being a hero to many Indians for defying British authority, his support for fascist regimes and opposition to granting Jewish refugees asylum in India led to a controversial reputation. Bose believed in authoritarianism as a means to bring liberation and reconstruction to Indian society, aligning himself with Axis powers and advocating for a strong central government with dictatorial powers. Subhas Chandra Bose's attempt to rid India of British rule during World War II left a troubled legacy due to his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, which were vexed by authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure. His collaborations with Japanese fascism and Nazism posed serious ethical dilemmas, especially his reluctance to criticize German anti-Semitism or offer refuge to its victims. Despite being seen as a hero by many in India, Bose's tactics and ideology were criticized by the Indian National Congress, the main instrument of Indian nationalism. Subhas Chandra Bose left a troubled legacy from his attempt to rid India of British rule during World War II due to his belief in using all means, including force, to achieve anti-colonial ends, which conflicted with Gandhi's non-violent approach. This led to a split in the Indian National Congress party, with Bose forming his own faction, the All India Forward Bloc, to consolidate the political left. Despite his efforts, Bose was forced to resign from the Congress presidency due to opposition from the Gandhi-led clique. Subhas Chandra Bose's attempt to rid India of British rule during World War II left a troubled legacy due to his escape to Nazi Germany and subsequent alliance with them. Bose founded the Free India Center in Berlin, created the Indian Legion, and pledged allegiance to Hitler, which raised concerns about his judgment. Disillusioned with Germany's help, he left for Japan, where he reorganized the Indian National Army and maintained support for the Azad Hind movement, urging Indians to join his fight against the British Raj. Subhas Chandra Bose's attempt to rid India of British rule during World War II left a troubled legacy. After his death in a plane crash in Japanese-ruled Formosa, conspiracy theories arose, with many supporters refusing to believe the circumstances of his death. The Indian National Congress considered Bose a patriot but misguided, as he collaborated with Japanese fascism. The British Raj tried 300 INA officers for treason in the INA trials, reflecting the conflicted views on the INA among Indian soldiers in the British Indian army. Bose's attempt to rid India of British rule during World War II left a troubled legacy due to his alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, which were fraught with authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure. Despite being a hero to many Indians for defying British authority, his association with Hitler and the Nazi regime raised ethical concerns, especially regarding his lack of concern for the victims of the Holocaust. Bose's wartime actions and alliances posed serious dilemmas given his popularity and previous fight for independence.\nThought 4: The troubled legacy left by Subhas Chandra Bose's attempt to rid India of British rule during World War II was marked by authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure. The original question asked about the war during which his attempt left a troubled legacy.

The boundary between the Colorado orogeny and the Wyoming craton is marked by the Cheyenne belt, a 5-km-wide mylonitic shear zone. The Paleoproterozoic rocks from the Colorado orogeny underwent metamorphism under moderate pressure and temperature conditions. The Colorado orogeny was likely part of the larger Yavapai orogeny, which extended across North America.\n\nThought 2: It mentions that the eastern sector of the Colorado orgeny is called the Central Plains orogeny, however it does not say anything about the elevation.

It is considered an extension of the fold belt in Colorado and southeastern Wyoming and is part of the Yavapai orogeny that occurred between 1780 and 1680 million years ago. The text does not specify the elevation range of the Central Plains orogeny.\n\nThought 3: There is no mention of the elevation of the Central Plains orogeny. However, observation 1 indicated that the central plains orogeny extended into the high plains and is part of the Yavapi orogeny.

It covers articles on health, fashion, and beauty.\nThought 3: Naj is a lifestyle and women's magazine. Since Woman's Era and Naj are mentioned together in the question, they might be similar in terms of being lifestyle or women's magazines. I should check if Woman's Era is also a lifestyle or women's magazine.\n\nAction 3: search | Woman's Era | what type of magazine is Woman's Era? | type of magazine\nObservation 3: There are no sentences in the text that specify the type of magazine Woman's Era is.

I should start by finding definitions for the Colorado orogeny and it's eastern sector. \n\nAction 1: search | Colorado orogeny | what is the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny and what is its elevation? | elevation\n\nObservation 1: The eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny is called the Central Plains orogeny and extends into the High Plains. The boundary between the Colorado orogeny and the Wyoming craton is marked by the Cheyenne belt, a 5-km-wide mylonitic shear zone. The Paleoproterozoic rocks from the Colorado orogeny underwent metamorphism under moderate pressure and temperature conditions. The Colorado orogeny was likely part of the larger Yavapai orogeny, which extended across North America.\n\nThought 2: It mentions that the eastern sector of the Colorado orgeny is called the Central Plains orogeny, however it does not say anything about the elevation. I should search for an article about the Central Plains orogeny and question its elevation range.\n\nAction 2: search | Central Plains orogeny | what is the elevation range of the Central Plains orogeny? | elevation\n\nObservation 2: The Central Plains orogeny is over 1,000 kilometers long and at least 500 kilometers wide, consisting of granitic and metamorphic rocks ranging from 1,630 to 1,800 million years in age. It is considered an extension of the fold belt in Colorado and southeastern Wyoming and is part of the Yavapai orogeny that occurred between 1780 and 1680 million years ago. The text does not specify the elevation range of the Central Plains orogeny.\n\nThought 3: There is no mention of the elevation of the Central Plains orogeny. However, observation 1 indicated that the central plains orogeny extended into the high plains and is part of the Yavapi orogeny. First I need to search the high plains and find its elevation, and if I still don't have an answer, I will look at the Yavapi orogeny.\n\nAction 3: search | high plains | what is the elevation of the high plains? | elevation\n\nObservation 3: There is no information in the text about the elevation of the High Plains.

The genus Polypodium is part of the Filices group of ferns recognized by Carl Linnaeus, which originally included 15 genera. The classification of ferns remains controversial, with different viewpoints on the number of genera, such as the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group recognizing 319 genera. No specific number of species in the genus Polypodium is mentioned in the text.\nThought 6: I couldn't find the exact number of species in Polypodium, but the text mentions that there are approximately 10,560 known extant species in the group of ferns. Since Polypodium is part of this group, it likely has a significant number of species. Given that Aichryson has about 15 species, it is safe to assume that Polypodium has more species.

The boundary between the Colorado orogeny and the Wyoming craton is marked by the Cheyenne belt, a 5-km-wide mylonitic shear zone. The Paleoproterozoic rocks from the Colorado orogeny underwent metamorphism under moderate pressure and temperature conditions. The Colorado orogeny was likely part of the larger Yavapai orogeny, which extended across North America.\n\nThought 2: It mentions that the eastern sector of the Colorado orgeny is called the Central Plains orogeny, however it does not say anything about the elevation. I should search for an article about the Central Plains orogeny and question its elevation range.\n\nAction 2: search | Central Plains orogeny | what is the elevation range of the Central Plains orogeny? | elevation\n\nObservation 2: The Central Plains orogeny is over 1,000 kilometers long and at least 500 kilometers wide, consisting of granitic and metamorphic rocks ranging from 1,630 to 1,800 million years in age. It is considered an extension of the fold belt in Colorado and southeastern Wyoming and is part of the Yavapai orogeny that occurred between 1780 and 1680 million years ago. The text does not specify the elevation range of the Central Plains orogeny.\n\nThought 3: There is no mention of the elevation of the Central Plains orogeny. However, observation 1 indicated that the central plains orogeny extended into the high plains and is part of the Yavapi orogeny. First I need to search the high plains and find its elevation, and if I still don't have an answer, I will look at the Yavapi orogeny.\n\nAction 3: search | high plains | what is the elevation of the high plains? | elevation\n\nObservation 3: There is no information in the text about the elevation of the High Plains. The text is about the 1973 American Western film \"High Plains Drifter,\" directed by Clint Eastwood, where a mysterious stranger seeks justice in a corrupt frontier mining town.\n\nThought 4: I searched high plains, but the text is clearly about the wrong high plains. Let me check similar articles to try and find something about the geographic high plains.\n\nAction 4: similar\n\nObservation 4: High Plains\n\nHigh Plains (United States)\n\nHigh Plains Invaders\n\nGreat Plains\n\nOgallala Aquifer\n\nThought 5: I should search the high plains of the united states and ask about the elevation\n\nAction 5: search | High Plains (United States) | what is the elevation of the high plains? | elevation\n\nObservation 5: The High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m) from east to west.\n\nThought 6: This is the answer, 1,800 to 7,000 ft. The initial question was \"What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\". My answer is a proper response to this type of question.
