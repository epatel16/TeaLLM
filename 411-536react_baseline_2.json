The Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River was fought from November 25 to December 2, 1950, during the Korean War. The battle was a decisive one, with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army launching a counteroffensive against the advancing UN forces. The aftermath of the battle saw significant casualties on both sides, with the US 2nd Infantry Division suffering heavy losses and being deemed crippled. The battle ultimately led to the US Eighth Army retreating from North Korea, marking one of the longest retreats in US military history.\nThought 3: The Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River was fought from November 25 to December 2, 1950, which means it was fought in the 20th century, not the 19th century.

Additionally, Kanhoji Angre's actions during the warring period between Tarabai and Shahu led to his alliance with Shahu, resulting in significant territorial gains for Shahu's empire. Chimaji Appa played a significant role in the life of the fifth Maratha Chhatrapati Shahu by engineering an internecine struggle among Maratha factions to secure Shahu's victory in the Battle of Khed, leading to his coronation as Chhatrapati. Shahu, under his reign, expanded Maratha power across various regions of India, creating a strong Maratha Empire. Additionally, Shahu was known for advancing the interests of the ryots, bringing barren lands under cultivation, and relieving the suffering of the poor by abolishing burdensome taxes. Chimaji Appa played a significant role in the conflict between Shahu and Sambhaji, leading a force against Shahu but ultimately failing due to Shahu's intervention.

The game received critical acclaim for its originality, unique gameplay, and dark humor. The antagonist, GLaDOS, and the end credits song \"Still Alive\" were particularly praised. Ellen McLain provided the voice for GLaDOS, and the game's protagonist, Chell, was modeled after Al\u00e9sia Glidewell. Portal is a part of the 2007 puzzle-platform game developed by Valve. It was released in The Orange Box bundle for various systems and has since been ported to other platforms like Mac OS X, Linux, Android, and Nintendo Switch. The game primarily involves solving puzzles using the \"portal gun\" to create portals between two flat planes, with the player-character Chell navigating through challenges set by the AI GLaDOS in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center.\nThought 4: The search results did not provide the specific information I needed about the 2012 action-adventure game that Portal is a part of.

The games center around a woman named Chell who undergoes tests in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center controlled by the AI GLaDOS. The gameplay involves using the \"Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device\" to create wormhole-like connections between surfaces, allowing for unique puzzle-solving mechanics. Portal and Portal 2 have received widespread acclaim for their gameplay, humor, and voice work, with Portal 2 being considered one of the greatest video games of all time.\nThought 6: The search results indicate that Portal is part of the Portal series, which includes Portal 2 released in 2011. Since there is no mention of a 2012 action-adventure game that Portal is a part of, I can conclude that the original question may have been misleading or incorrect.

The defeat of the Spanish led to a civil war between unitarians and federalists, and the presidency of Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre saw economic improvements and the War of the Triple Alliance. \nThought 3: Since I couldn't find specific information on the removal event of Viceroy Baltasar Hildalgo de Cisneros, I should try to narrow down my search to events related to the time period when he was in power to find the answer.\n\nAction 3: search | Viceroy Baltasar Hildalgo de Cisneros | events during his rule | historical events\nObservation 3: No articles or similar articles were found with this topic.

I should start by finding definitions for the Colorado orogeny and it's eastern sector. \n\nAction 1: search | Colorado orogeny | what is the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny and what is its elevation? | elevation\n\nObservation 1: The eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny is called the Central Plains orogeny and extends into the High Plains. The boundary between the Colorado orogeny and the Wyoming craton is marked by the Cheyenne belt, a 5-km-wide mylonitic shear zone. The Paleoproterozoic rocks from the Colorado orogeny underwent metamorphism under moderate pressure and temperature conditions. The Colorado orogeny was likely part of the larger Yavapai orogeny, which extended across North America.\n\nThought 2: It mentions that the eastern sector of the Colorado orgeny is called the Central Plains orogeny, however it does not say anything about the elevation. I should search for an article about the Central Plains orogeny and question its elevation range.\n\nAction 2: search | Central Plains orogeny | what is the elevation range of the Central Plains orogeny? | elevation\n\nObservation 2: The Central Plains orogeny is over 1,000 kilometers long and at least 500 kilometers wide, consisting of granitic and metamorphic rocks ranging from 1,630 to 1,800 million years in age. It is considered an extension of the fold belt in Colorado and southeastern Wyoming and is part of the Yavapai orogeny that occurred between 1780 and 1680 million years ago. The text does not specify the elevation range of the Central Plains orogeny.\n\nThought 3: There is no mention of the elevation of the Central Plains orogeny. However, observation 1 indicated that the central plains orogeny extended into the high plains and is part of the Yavapi orogeny. First I need to search the high plains and find its elevation, and if I still don't have an answer, I will look at the Yavapi orogeny.\n\nAction 3: search | high plains | what is the elevation of the high plains? | elevation\n\nObservation 3: There is no information in the text about the elevation of the High Plains.

The conflict was supported by various countries, with North Korea backed by China and the Soviet Union, and South Korea supported by the United Nations Command led by the United States. The Battle of Osan marked the first significant U.S. engagement in the war, with Task Force Smith suffering casualties due to a lack of weapons capable of destroying North Korean tanks. The Korean War took place between North Korea and South Korea from 1950 to 1953, starting on June 25, 1950, when North Korea invaded South Korea and ending with an armistice on July 27, 1953. The Korean War took place from 1950 to 1953, starting on June 25, 1950, when North Korea invaded South Korea and ending with an armistice on July 27, 1953. The conflict was supported by various countries, with North Korea backed by China and the Soviet Union, and South Korea supported by the United Nations Command led by the United States. Peace negotiations continued for two years, with a major point of contention being prisoner of war repatriation. The war officially ended with the signing of an armistice agreement on July 27, 1953, establishing the Korean Demilitarized Zone along the front line.\nThought 2: The Korean War took place from 1950 to 1953. Now, I need to search for the dates of The Western Allied invasion of Germany to compare them.\n\nAction 2: search | Western Allied invasion of Germany | when did the Western Allied invasion of Germany take place? | dates\nObservation 2: The Western Allied invasion of Germany took place at the beginning of 1945, with General Dwight D. Eisenhower commanding 90 divisions, including 25 armored divisions. The invasion was organized into three army groups, with the 21st Army Group commanded by Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery in the north, the 12th Army Group under Lieutenant General Omar Bradley in the middle, and the 6th Army Group commanded by Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers in the south. The Allies faced resistance from the German Army commanded by Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, who had limited resources for a coherent defense. Eisenhower's plans for the final drive across the Rhine and into Germany were adjusted due to various factors, including the Soviet advance towards Berlin and the importance of the southern offensives. The Western Allied invasion of Germany took place on the night of 23/24 March, with American troops crossing the Rhine without aerial bombardment or airborne troops. The assault elements of the British 2nd Army massed against three main crossing sites: Rees, Xanten, and Wesel, with the 9th Army divisions concentrating in the Rheinberg area south of Wesel. The American crossing was successful, with the 30th and 79th Infantry Divisions crossing the Rhine and pushing east, penetrating the German defensive line. The Western Allied invasion of Germany took place in March and April. The 6th Army Group made an assault across the Rhine on March 26th, and by April 1st, elements of the 2nd and 3rd Armored Divisions met at Lippstadt, linking the 9th and 1st Armies and sealing the Ruhr industrial complex within American lines. The eradication of the Ruhr Pocket was completed by April 18th, with the final tally of prisoners taken reaching 325,000. The Western Allied invasion of Germany took place in April 1945. The 12th U.S. Army Group, under Bradley's command, made the main effort with the 1st Army heading east towards Leipzig and the Elbe River. The 9th Army also aimed for the Elbe, while Patton's 3rd Army moved eastward to Chemnitz and then southeast into Austria. The 12th U.S. Army Group's drive to the Elbe began on April 10th, with elements of the 9th Army reaching the Elbe southeast of Magdeburg by April 11th. The Western Allied invasion of Germany took place in April and May 1945. The Allied armies advanced towards Berlin, with the British Second Army reaching the Elbe southeast of Hamburg on April 19th. The Polish 1st Armoured Division accepted the capitulation of the Kriegsmarine naval base in Wilhelmshaven on May 6th. The invasion led to the end of the war in Europe, with Hitler committing suicide on April 30th and the complete surrender on all fronts being effective on May 8th.\nThought 3: The Western Allied invasion of Germany took place in April 1945, while the Korean War started in June 1950.

I should start by finding definitions for the Colorado orogeny and it's eastern sector. \n\nAction 1: search | Colorado orogeny | what is the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny and what is its elevation? | elevation\n\nObservation 1: The eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny is called the Central Plains orogeny and extends into the High Plains. The boundary between the Colorado orogeny and the Wyoming craton is marked by the Cheyenne belt, a 5-km-wide mylonitic shear zone. The Paleoproterozoic rocks from the Colorado orogeny underwent metamorphism under moderate pressure and temperature conditions. The Colorado orogeny was likely part of the larger Yavapai orogeny, which extended across North America.\n\nThought 2: It mentions that the eastern sector of the Colorado orgeny is called the Central Plains orogeny, however it does not say anything about the elevation. I should search for an article about the Central Plains orogeny and question its elevation range.\n\nAction 2: search | Central Plains orogeny | what is the elevation range of the Central Plains orogeny? | elevation\n\nObservation 2: The Central Plains orogeny is over 1,000 kilometers long and at least 500 kilometers wide, consisting of granitic and metamorphic rocks ranging from 1,630 to 1,800 million years in age. It is considered an extension of the fold belt in Colorado and southeastern Wyoming and is part of the Yavapai orogeny that occurred between 1780 and 1680 million years ago. The text does not specify the elevation range of the Central Plains orogeny.\n\nThought 3: There is no mention of the elevation of the Central Plains orogeny. However, observation 1 indicated that the central plains orogeny extended into the high plains and is part of the Yavapi orogeny. First I need to search the high plains and find its elevation, and if I still don't have an answer, I will look at the Yavapi orogeny.\n\nAction 3: search | high plains | what is the elevation of the high plains? | elevation\n\nObservation 3: There is no information in the text about the elevation of the High Plains. The text is about the 1973 American Western film \"High Plains Drifter,\" directed by Clint Eastwood, where a mysterious stranger seeks justice in a corrupt frontier mining town.\n\nThought 4: I searched high plains, but the text is clearly about the wrong high plains. Let me check similar articles to try and find something about the geographic high plains.\n\nAction 4: similar\n\nObservation 4: High Plains\n\nHigh Plains (United States)\n\nHigh Plains Invaders\n\nGreat Plains\n\nOgallala Aquifer\n\nThought 5: I should search the high plains of the united states and ask about the elevation\n\nAction 5: search | High Plains (United States) | what is the elevation of the high plains? | elevation\n\nObservation 5: The High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m) from east to west.\n\nThought 6: This is the answer, 1,800 to 7,000 ft. The initial question was \"What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?\". My answer is a proper response to this type of question. I should finish the session.\n\nAction 6: finish | 1,800 to 7,000 ft\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2:\n\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\n\nThought 1: The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.\n\nAction 1: search | Milhouse | who is Milhouse named after? | named after\n\nObservation 1: Milhouse from \"The Simpsons\" is named after U.S. president Richard Milhous Nixon, chosen by Matt Groening as the most \"unfortunate name\" he could think of for a kid. The character was initially designed for a Butterfinger commercial before being included in the series. Additionally, Milhouse\\'s last name was given by Howard Gewirtz, a freelance writer, who took it from one of his wife\\'s friends.\n\nThought 2: It states that Milhouse is named after U.S. president Richard Milhous Nixon, who was chosen by Matt Groening as the most \"unfortunate name\" he could think of for a kid. The original question asked about who Milhouse was named after. Thus, I can answer the question with Richard Milhous Nixon.\n\nAction 2: finish | Richard Milhous Nixon\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 3:\n\nQuestion: Which famous Bollywood actor, who's name starts with H, has an extra thumb?\n\nThought 1: I should search up bollywood actors and look for one with an extra thumb\n\nAction 1: search | bollywood actors | which actor has an extra thumb? | extra thumb\n\nObservation 1: There is no information in the text about an actor having an extra thumb. \\n\\nHindi cinema, known as Bollywood, is a major part of the Indian film industry, producing a large number of films each year. The industry is based in Mumbai and has been a significant center for film production globally. Bollywood films often incorporate elements of action, comedy, romance, drama, and music.\n\nThought 2: There don't seem to be details about actors, however the article seems to have lots of information about Bollywood. I should crawl through this article for famous bollywood actors who's name starts with H and check each of their Wikipedia pages for an actor with an extra thumb.\n\nAction 2: crawl | who are some famous bollywood actors who's name starts with H?\n\nObservation 2: Hrithik Roshan, Helen (actress)\n\nThought 3: I will start by checking Hrithik Roshan's Wikipedia page for whether he has an extra thumb\n\nAction 3: search | Hrithik Roshan | does Hrithik Roshan have an extra thumb? | extra thumb\n\nObservation 3: Hrithik Roshan was born with an extra thumb fused to the one on his right hand, which caused him to feel isolated as a child. He has also stammered since the age of six, leading to difficulties at school. Despite these challenges, he has become a successful Indian actor known for his dancing skills and has won numerous awards for his performances.\n\nThought 4: Hrithik Roshan has an extra thumb and his name starts with H. The original question asked for a person, specifically a bollywood actor. Due to my earlier reasoning, Hrithik Roshan must be the correct answer.\n\nAction 4: finish | Hrithik Roshan\n\n\nQuestion: What number president was Annie Caputo nominated by to become a member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?\nThought 1: I need to find out which president nominated Annie Caputo to become a member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
