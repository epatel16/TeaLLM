Dependent territories are distinct from country subdivisions and often have a significant degree of autonomy from their controlling state.

I should search for one of these specific types, like Crown Dependencies, to see what they can contain.\n\nAction 3: search | Crown Dependencies | what can Crown Dependencies contain besides being politically outside of the controlling state's integral area? | contents\nObservation 3: The Crown Dependencies, including the Bailiwick of Guernsey, the Bailiwick of Jersey, and the Isle of Man, are self-governing territories under the British Crown but are not part of the United Kingdom or British Overseas Territories. They have wide powers of self-government and are considered territories for which the UK is responsible. The UK Parliament can legislate for the Crown Dependencies without prior consultation, but the UK is expected to seek permission from them before doing so. Acts of the UK Parliament do not usually apply to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man unless explicitly stated, and each dependency retains its own distinct legal system. The Crown Dependencies, including the Bailiwick of Guernsey, the Bailiwick of Jersey, and the Isle of Man, are self-governing territories under the British Crown but are not part of the UK or British Overseas Territories. They have wide powers of self-government and have relationships with international organizations like the Commonwealth, although they are not independent members. The Crown Dependencies have lobbied for a more integrated relationship with the Commonwealth, and during Brexit negotiations, the UK government committed to representing their interests in international relations.\nThought 4: The information about Crown Dependencies does not specifically mention what they can contain besides being politically outside of the controlling state's integral area. I should search for more general information about dependent territories to see if there are any common characteristics in terms of what they can contain.\n\nAction 4: search | dependent territories | common characteristics of what dependent territories can contain | contents\nObservation 4: There are common characteristics of dependent territories, which include not possessing full political independence or sovereignty as a sovereign state, remaining politically outside the controlling state's integral area, and ranging from associated states to non-self-governing territories. These territories are often distinguished from country subdivisions by not being considered a constituent part of a sovereign state and maintaining a significant degree of autonomy from the controlling state. Additionally, most inhabited dependent territories have their own ISO 3166 country codes.\nThought 5: The search results provide common characteristics of dependent territories but do not specifically mention what they can contain besides being politically outside of the controlling state's integral area. I should search for specific examples of dependent territories and see if there is any information about their contents.\n\nAction 5: search | specific examples of dependent territories | what do dependent territories contain? | contents\nObservation 5: There are 14 British Overseas Territories (BOTs) that are part of the UK's sovereign territory but not part of the UK itself. These territories have varying degrees of internal self-governance, with the UK retaining responsibility for defense, foreign relations, and internal security. The territories have permanent civilian populations, except for a few like the British Antarctic Territory and the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands. The British monarch serves as the head of state for all 14 territories. \nThought 6: The information about British Overseas Territories provides some insight into what dependent territories can contain, such as varying degrees of internal self-governance and the UK retaining certain responsibilities. However, it does not fully answer the question about what else dependent territories can contain besides being politically outside of the controlling state's integral area. I should try to find more specific examples or information that directly address the question.\n\nAction 6: search | examples of contents in dependent territories | what can dependent territories contain? | contents\nObservation 6: There are three sets of country codes defined by ISO 3166-1: alphabetic, numeric, and reserved or user-assigned codes. Dependent territories, former countries, overseas territories, and international organizations are examples of entities that may have reserved codes. User-assigned codes are available for users to add names of countries, territories, or other geographical entities to their in-house applications of ISO 3166-1. ISO 3166-1 is updated by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency when necessary, especially when countries change their names or territorial boundaries.\nThought 7: The search results about ISO 3166 country codes do not directly address what else dependent territories can contain besides being politically outside of the controlling state's integral area.
