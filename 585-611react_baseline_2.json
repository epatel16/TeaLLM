The boundary between the Colorado orogeny and the Wyoming craton is marked by the Cheyenne belt, a 5-km-wide mylonitic shear zone. The Paleoproterozoic rocks from the Colorado orogeny underwent metamorphism under moderate pressure and temperature conditions.

The First Folio includes plays like Henry VIII, Henry VI, Part 1, and Timon of Athens, which are believed to be collaborative according to modern stylistic analysis. However, some scholars have also rejected the idea of collaboration, arguing that most plays were solely written by Shakespeare, with only a few being partly revised by others.\nThought 4: The Shakespeare apocrypha suggests that there is evidence of collaboration in Shakespeare's plays, with some scholars believing that certain plays may have been collaborations between Shakespeare and other dramatists. This information aligns with the original question about the likelihood of collaboration on a William Shakespeare play written between 1588 and 1593.\n\nAction 4: finish | Evidence of potential collaboration in Shakespeare's plays between 1588-1593\nObservation 4: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n"}, {"steps": 2, "answer": " Vince Guaraldi", "gt_answer": "Vincent Anthony Guaraldi", "question_idx": 586, "reward": false, "em": false, "f1": 0.4, "n_calls": 2, "n_badcalls": 0, "traj": "Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps.

He worked as a tailor in several frontier towns before entering politics. Johnson implemented his own form of Presidential Reconstruction, which led to conflict with the Republican-dominated Congress and his impeachment in 1868. He was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, on December 29, 1808, and his humble origins were frequently highlighted during his political career. Johnson died at the age of 66 after suffering a stroke while traveling to give speeches in Ohio. His funeral was held in Greeneville, where he was buried with an American flag and a copy of the U.S. Constitution. Historians have varied opinions on Johnson's presidency, with some viewing him as flawed and politically inept, while others see his Reconstruction policies as fundamentally correct. In the early 21st century, Johnson is often considered one of the worst presidents in U.S. history due to his impeachment, handling of Reconstruction, and resistance to policies benefiting newly emancipated African-Americans. Andrew Johnson died at the age of 66 after suffering a stroke while on a trip to give speeches in Ohio. His funeral was held in Greeneville, where he was buried with an American flag and a copy of the U.S. Constitution as per his wishes.
