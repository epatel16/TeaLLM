QUESTION:
What foods should dogs eat?

TEXT:
Dogs have been described as omnivores.[5][131][132] Compared to wolves, dogs from agricultural societies have extra copies of amylase and other genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet.[4] Similar to humans, some dog breeds produce amylase in their saliva and are classified as having a high-starch diet.[133] However, more like cats and less like other omnivores, dogs can only produce bile acid with taurine, and they cannot produce vitamin D, which they obtain from animal flesh. Of the twenty-one amino acids common to all life forms (including selenocysteine), dogs cannot synthesize ten: arginine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine.[134][135][136] Like cats, dogs require arginine to maintain nitrogen balance. These nutritional requirements place dogs halfway between carnivores and omnivores.[137]

The keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by élites, has a long history.[151] Pet-dog populations grew significantly after World War II as suburbanization increased.[151] In the 1980s, there have been changes in the pet dog's functions, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians.[152][page needed][153][page needed][154] Within the second half of the 20th century, the first dogs' social status major shift has been  "commodification", shaping it[clarification needed] to conform to social expectations of personality and behavior.[154] The second has been the broadening of the concepts of family and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices.[154]

A vast range of commodity forms aim to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion.[155] The list of goods and services available for dogs, such as dog-training books, classes, and television programs, has increased.[156][155] The majority of contemporary dog-owners describe their pet as part of the family, although some state that it is an ambivalent relationship.[154] Some dog-trainers, such as on the television program Dog Whisperer, have promoted a dominance model of dog-human relationships. However, the idea of the  "alpha dog" trying to be dominant is based on a controversial theory about wolf packs.[157][158] It has been disputed that "trying to achieve status" is characteristic of dog-human interactions.[159] Human family members have increased participation in activities in which the dog is an integral partner, such as dog dancing and dog yoga.[155]

According to statistics published by the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2009–2010, an estimated 77.5 million people in the United States have pet dogs.[160] The source shows that nearly 40% of American households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% own two dogs, and nearly 9% own more than two dogs. The data also shows an equal number of male and female pet dogs; less than one-fifth of the owned dogs come from shelters.[161]

Dogs as introduced predator-mammals can affect the ecology of (for example) New Zealand, which lacked indigenous land-based mammals before human settlement.[162]

Some breeds of dogs are prone to specific genetic ailments such as elbow and hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, a cleft palate, and trick knees. Two severe medical conditions significantly affecting dogs are pyometra, affecting unspayed females of all breeds and ages, and gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), which affects larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as fleas, ticks, mites, hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms that can live in their hearts.[40]

Several human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs, including chocolate solids, causing theobromine poisoning, onions and garlic, causing thiosulfate, sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning, grapes and raisins, macadamia nuts, and xylitol.[41] The nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous to dogs. Signs of ingestion can include copious vomiting (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea. The symptoms of hydrocarbon mixture indigestion can be abdominal pain, aspiration pneumonia, oral ulcers, vomiting, or death.[42][43] The most common deaths among dogs were neoplasia and heart disease, followed by toxicosis and gastrointestinal disease.[44][45][46] A 20-year-record study found that respiratory disease was the most common cause of death in Bulldogs.[47] Puppies were more likely to die from infection or congenital disease.[48] Dogs can also have some of the same health conditions as humans, including diabetes, dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis. Type 1 diabetes mellitus, resembling human diabetes, is the type of diabetes seen most often in dogs.[49] Their pathology is similar to that of humans, as is their response to treatment and their outcomes. The genes involved in canine obsessive-compulsive disorders led to the detection of four genes in humans' related pathways.[20]

The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but the median longevity (the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive) is approximately 12.7 years.[50][51] Obesity correlates negatively with longevity with one study finding obese dogs have a life expectancy approximately a year and a half less than dogs with a healthy weight.[50]

Your response:
Dogs are halfway between carnivores and omnivores, and those from agricultural societies have an increased ability to thrive on starch-rich diet due to extra copies of enzymes. Several human foods are toxic to dogs, like chocolate, onions, garlic, grapes, raisins, macadamia nuts, and xylitol.
