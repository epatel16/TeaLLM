The boundary between the Colorado orogeny and the Wyoming craton is marked by the Cheyenne belt, a 5-km-wide mylonitic shear zone. The Paleoproterozoic rocks from the Colorado orogeny underwent metamorphism under moderate pressure and temperature conditions. The Colorado orogeny was likely part of the larger Yavapai orogeny, which extended across North America.\n\nThought 2: It mentions that the eastern sector of the Colorado orgeny is called the Central Plains orogeny, however it does not say anything about the elevation. I should search for an article about the Central Plains orogeny and question its elevation range.\n\nAction 2: search | Central Plains orogeny | what is the elevation range of the Central Plains orogeny? | elevation\n\nObservation 2: The Central Plains orogeny is over 1,000 kilometers long and at least 500 kilometers wide, consisting of granitic and metamorphic rocks ranging from 1,630 to 1,800 million years in age. It is considered an extension of the fold belt in Colorado and southeastern Wyoming and is part of the Yavapai orogeny that occurred between 1780 and 1680 million years ago. The text does not specify the elevation range of the Central Plains orogeny.\n\nThought 3: There is no mention of the elevation of the Central Plains orogeny. However, observation 1 indicated that the central plains orogeny extended into the high plains and is part of the Yavapi orogeny. First I need to search the high plains and find its elevation, and if I still don't have an answer, I will look at the Yavapi orogeny.\n\nAction 3: search | high plains | what is the elevation of the high plains? | elevation\n\nObservation 3: There is no information in the text about the elevation of the High Plains. The text is about the 1973 American Western film \"High Plains Drifter,\" directed by Clint Eastwood, where a mysterious stranger seeks justice in a corrupt frontier mining town.\n\nThought 4: I searched high plains, but the text is clearly about the wrong high plains. Let me check similar articles to try and find something about the geographic high plains.\n\nAction 4: similar\n\nObservation 4: High Plains\n\nHigh Plains (United States)\n\nHigh Plains Invaders\n\nGreat Plains\n\nOgallala Aquifer\n\nThought 5: I should search the high plains of the united states and ask about the elevation\n\nAction 5: search | High Plains (United States) | what is the elevation of the high plains? | elevation\n\nObservation 5: The High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m) from east to west.\n\nThought 6: This is the answer, 1,800 to 7,000 ft.

The character was initially designed for a Butterfinger commercial before being included in the series. Additionally, Milhouse\\'s last name was given by Howard Gewirtz, a freelance writer, who took it from one of his wife\\'s friends.\n\nThought 2: It states that Milhouse is named after U.S. president Richard Milhous Nixon, who was chosen by Matt Groening as the most \"unfortunate name\" he could think of for a kid.

Bollywood films often incorporate elements of action, comedy, romance, drama, and music.\n\nThought 2: There don't seem to be details about actors, however the article seems to have lots of information about Bollywood. I should crawl through this article for famous bollywood actors who's name starts with H and check each of their Wikipedia pages for an actor with an extra thumb.\n\nAction 2: crawl | who are some famous bollywood actors who's name starts with H?\n\nObservation 2: Hrithik Roshan, Helen (actress)\n\nThought 3: I will start by checking Hrithik Roshan's Wikipedia page for whether he has an extra thumb\n\nAction 3: search | Hrithik Roshan | does Hrithik Roshan have an extra thumb? | extra thumb\n\nObservation 3: Hrithik Roshan was born with an extra thumb fused to the one on his right hand, which caused him to feel isolated as a child.

Despite these challenges, he has become a successful Indian actor known for his dancing skills and has won numerous awards for his performances.\n\nThought 4: Hrithik Roshan has an extra thumb and his name starts with H. The original question asked for a person, specifically a bollywood actor.
